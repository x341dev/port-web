    aboutContent: `Hi there! I'm Kira.

I'm a Full Stack developer on a mission: to create immersive experiences that leave a mark. I wrote my first lines of code when I was just 10 years old, and what started as a game turned into my true calling.\n

I move fluidly between the Front-end (React, TypeScript, Tailwind) and the Back-end, though the latter is definitely my specialty. I don't just care about code working; I care about it being good. I'm a big fan of Clean Code and using tools like Jenkins and SonarQube to keep the "machinery" running smoothly and bug-free.\n

My ultimate goal? Video games. I've been fascinated by them since I was a kid, and my dream is to bring all my technical skills into game development to build worlds of my own.\n`,
